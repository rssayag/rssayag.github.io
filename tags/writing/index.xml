Have you ever written a academic paper as a single author? Did you ever struggle how to find the correct wording to describe the paper? What do most authors do? Have that changed over time? What do experienced authors do?
Whether it was for a course assignment or a peer-reviewed article, at some point you were probably told that neutral and passive writing is preferred.</description>

How do writers refer to their own single author work when writing about it? Do they use singular pronouns (e.g. ‘I predict the existence of a 9th planet’), more participative plural pronouns (e.g. ‘Our model fits the observed data’), or avoid pronouns all together (e.g. ‘The paper examines tool usage by parrots’)? Is there a difference between male and female authors?</description>
