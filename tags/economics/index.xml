Would you rather contribute to a charity with the goal of saving children’s lives or to a charity that aims at preventing the deaths of children? Both charities’ goals are identical, but many would prefer to contribute to the second charity rather to the first one. The first charity’s goal is framed as making a gain while the second is framed as preventing a loss.</description>

The Book of Genesis describes God’s decision to punish Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness. God tells Abraham about his intention, turning Abraham into an advocate for the two cities. In his new role, Abraham bargains with God over the threshold of evidence required to find Sodom and Gomorrah guilty. Step by step, Abraham succeeds in decreasing the number of righteous people required to demonstrate there is a reasonable doubt that the cities are guilty of wickedness.</description>

Have you ever written a academic paper as a single author? Did you ever struggle how to find the correct wording to describe the paper? What do most authors do? Have that changed over time? What do experienced authors do?
Whether it was for a course assignment or a peer-reviewed article, at some point you were probably told that neutral and passive writing is preferred.</description>

How do writers refer to their own single author work when writing about it? Do they use singular pronouns (e.g. ‘I predict the existence of a 9th planet’), more participative plural pronouns (e.g. ‘Our model fits the observed data’), or avoid pronouns all together (e.g. ‘The paper examines tool usage by parrots’)? Is there a difference between male and female authors?</description>

      <title>It&#39;s the economy stupid: Why can (and should) Europe welcome many more refugees</title>

How many refugees can European countries reasonably take? How many should they take? Although some on the European right believe the answer is none, most agree that some refugees must be accepted. To look at the burden refugees place on host countries, some (Vox, The Economist) look at the number of refugees taken by countries relatively to those countries’ population size. This makes intuitive sense – for example, the more populated a country is the more people work per refugee, the lower is the burden of integration on individual communities, and the more secure people are that their country’s culture is not altered.</description>

      <title>Which are the fastest (and slowest) running countries in the world?</title>

As running becomes more and more popular around the world, the need to rank countries by the speed of their runners is clearly needed. Why should I care you ask? It’s a good point you’re making I’d retort, but we seem to like ranking of all sorts of things so why not? We rank countries by feelings of love, Cities by bike-friendliness, and even professions by right swipes.</description>
