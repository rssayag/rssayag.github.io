How do writers refer to their own single author work when writing about it? Do they use singular pronouns (e.g. ‘I predict the existence of a 9th planet’), more participative plural pronouns (e.g. ‘Our model fits the observed data’), or avoid pronouns all together (e.g. ‘The paper examines tool usage by parrots’)? Is there a difference between male and female authors?</description>
